OpenFst - Release 1.0

OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and
searching weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).

REQUIREMENTS:
  This version is known to work under Linux, MacOS, and Solaris using 
  g++ (>= 4.1). Expected to work wherever tr1 ordered sets/maps 
  (<tr1/ordered_set>, <tr1/ordered_map>) and dlopen (<dlfcn.h>, -ldl) 
  are available.
  	
INSTALLATION:
  Follow the generic GNU build system instructions in ./INSTALL.

  (Compiling with '-Wall -Wno-sign-compare' under g++ should give no
  warnings from this library).

USAGE:
  Assuming you've installed under the default /usr/local, the FST
  binaries are found on /usr/local/bin. To use in your own program,
  include <fst/fstlib.h> and compile with '-I /usr/local/include'. 
  Link against /usr/local/lib/libfst.so and -ldl. Set your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or equivalent) to contain /usr/local/lib. The
  linking is, by default, dynamic so that the Fst and Arc type DSO
  extensions can be used correctly if desired.

DOCUMENTATION: 
  See www.openfst.org for general documentation.
  See ./NEWS for updates since the last release.
