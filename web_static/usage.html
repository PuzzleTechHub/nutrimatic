<h2><a name="what">What It Is</a></h2>

<p>Nutrimatic is a pattern-matching word-search tool designed for puzzle
solving and construction, based on a dictionary of words and phrases that
commonly occur in Wikipedia, using a regular expression based pattern
syntax.</p>

<p>Word-pattern-matching tools, like
<a href="http://www.crosswordman.com/">TEA</a> (defunct, alas),
<a href="http://onelook.com/">OneLook</a>,
<a href="http://www.oneacross.com/">One Across</a>, and
<a href="https://www.unscramblerer.com/">Unscramblerer</a> are popular and
invaluable tools for puzzle solving and construction. They answer questions
like "what word starts with 'kr', ends with 'w', and is six letters long?"
(Krakow, capital of Poland.) Anagram tools such as the
<a href="http://wordsmith.org/anagram/">Internet Anagram Server</a> and
<a href="http://www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html">Andy's Anagram Solver</a>
are also useful when the order of the letters isn't fixed.</p>

<p>Nutrimatic is sort of like these things (especially TEA, hence the name),
except:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rather than a fixed dictionary, Nutrimatic uses a list of every word and
phrase that occurs in Wikipedia at least 5 times.  This means that not only are
English words included, but so are many celebrity names, place names,
catchphrases, famous quotes, common idioms, and so on.  (Unfortunately, it can
also include common misspellings, like "epsiode" and
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh">teh</a>".)</p>

<li><p>Nutrimatic can also match combinations of words and phrases it knows
about.  If the only vaguely English-like thing that matches your pattern is
the phrase
"<a href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/Men%20In%20Black/">subject
of blood and whiskey</a>", Nutrimatic can find it, without even being told the
word boundaries.</p>

<li><p>Normally a very large dictionary and support for combined phrases would
leave you drowning in obscure matches to your query.  (Other systems give you
a choice between small dictionaries of common words and large dictionaries with
many obscure words.)  Nutrimatic orders the results by corpus frequency, so
"reasonable" matches come first, followed by "stretchy" or "obscure" ones.</p>

<li><p>Nutrimatic supports arbitrary
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
expressions</a> (with <a href="#syntax">some extensions</a>) as well as
<a href="#syntax_anagram">anagram search</a> (including anagrams of chunks and
anagrams with missing data) in the same expression language.</p>

<li><p>Nutrimatic is open source, and available as a <a href="/">web
interface</a> and as command line tools.  (It is not currently available as a
GUI app.)</p>

<li><p>Nutrimatic is kind of slow sometimes, and queries can get cut off if
they take more than 30 seconds or search more than 1,000,000 nodes.
Certain expressions, especially involving long anagrams (more than 10-15
parts) can give the expression parser trouble.  Things which are fast in
other engines, such as matches constrained to single words, are generally
fast in Nutrimatic, though.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="syntax">Pattern Language Syntax</a></h2>

<p>Nutrimatic's query language is based on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
expressions</a>, in particular 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_Extended_Regular_Expressions">POSIX
extended regular expressions</a> (but without POSIX character classes).</p>

<p>The text (words and phrases) being matched has been normalized so that it
is all lowercase and contains no punctuation -- only letters, numbers, and spaces.
Most punctuation is turned into spaces, but apostrophes are simply removed, so
"Fleur-de-lis" shows up as "fleur de lis", and "I'm Jack's total lack of
surprise." is "im jacks total lack of surprise".  Spaces are matched
automatically by default; see the section on "<a href="#syntax_quotes">quoted
phrases</a>" below for details.</p>

<p>Because only letters and lowercase letters show up in the text, uppercase
letters and punctuation symbols are available to mean other things in queries.
Nutrimatic adds several such extensions:</p>

<h4><a name="syntax_chars">Character Classes</a></h4>

<p>For convenience, some uppercase letters and punctuation marks refer to
commonly used classes of characters:</p>

<dl>
<dd><tt><b>A</b></tt> - any alphabetic character, equivalent to <tt>[a-z]</tt>
<dd><tt><b>C</b></tt> - any consonant (including y), equivalent to
<tt>[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]</tt>
<dd><tt><b>V</b></tt> - any vowel (excluding y), equivalent to <tt>[aeiou]</tt>
<dd><tt><b>_</b></tt> (underscore) - any letter or number, equivalent to
<tt>[a-z0-9]</tt>
<dd><tt><b>-</b></tt> (hyphen) - an optional space, equivalent to <tt>( ?)</tt>
<dd><tt><b>#</b></tt> (number sign) - any digit, equivalent to <tt>[0-9]</tt>
</dl>

<p>Note that the hyphen and the underscore (as opposed to the standard regular
expression dot "<tt>.</tt>") are only really useful inside
"<a href="#syntax_quotes">quoted phrases</a>", though technically they are
allowed anywhere.</p>

<h4><a name="syntax_quotes">"Quoted Phrases"</a></h4>

<p>By default, Nutrimatic allows spaces to be inserted anywhere in the
expression when matching.  That means that an expression like
<tt><a href="/?q=CVCVCVCVCV">CVCVCVCVCV</a></tt> (five alternating
consonant-vowel pairs) matches words like "literature" as well as phrase
fragments like "have become" or "was used as a".</p>

<p>To restrict where spaces can be placed, use <tt>"<em>quoted
phrases</em>"</tt> in the pattern.
Within the quotation marks, spaces will not be inserted unless the pattern
specifically allows them.  So the expression
<tt><a href="/?q=%22CVCVCVCVCV%22">"CVCVCVCVCV"</a></tt> only matches single
10-letter words; <tt><a href="/?q=%22CVCVC-VCVCV%22">"CVCVC-VCVCV"</a></tt>
matches either single words or evenly split pairs of 5-letter words;
<tt><a href="/?q=%22CVCVC%20VCVCV%22">"CVCVC VCVCV"</a></tt> matches only pairs
of 5-letter words.</p>

<p>Quotation marks can be used on all or part of the query, as desired.</p>

<h4><a name="syntax_amp">&amp; (Intersection)</a></h4>

<p>By analogy with the standard <tt>|</tt> (alternation) operator, the &amp;
operator requires both sides to match for the pattern to match.  This is useful
for applying several constraints in parallel.  For example,
<tt><a href="/?q=%22_*a_*%26_*b_*%26_*c_*%26_{5,}%22">"_*a_*&amp;_*b_*&amp;_*c_*&amp;_{5,}"</a></tt>
matches single words that contain all of "a", "b" and "c" (but in no
particular order) and are also at least 5 letters long overall.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> The <tt>&amp;</tt> operator can be expensive to parse.  Large
numbers (10+) of combined expressions can take exponentially long to process.
This is not an issue in most cases.</p> 

<h4><a name="syntax_anagram">&lt;Anagrams&gt;</a></h4>

<p>Text inside <tt>&lt;<em>angle brackets</em>&gt;</tt> matches anything that
contains the same parts but in any order.  So
<tt><a href="/?q=%3Ccat%3E">&lt;act&gt;</a></tt> matches "act", "cat", "atc" and
so on.</p>

<p>The parts of an anagram are normally letters, but can themselves be any
regular expression (in parentheses).  For example,
<tt><a href="/?q=%3C%28ag%29%28m%29%28ra%29__%3E">&lt;(ag)(m)(ra)__&gt;</a></tt>
matches any 7-letter word or phrase containing "ag", "m", "ra", and any
other two letters.  Anagrams can also be part of a larger expression, if
you have partial information about the order of something, such as
<tt><a href="/?q=%3Caan%3Eg%3Camr%3E">&lt;aan&gt;g&lt;amr&gt;</a></tt> which
matches "anagram" but not "margana".</p>

<p>Remember, if you want to restrict your anagram to single words, use
"<a href="#syntax_quotes">quoted phrases</a>".</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Anagrams, especially large or complex anagrams (more than
10-15 letters, or using several chunks which are different but can match the
same text, or are deeply nested), can be very slow to parse and to search.</p>

<p><b>Bug:</b> The anagram algorithm isn't perfect -- when using anagrams of 
wildcards or pieces that aren't single letters, sometimes results will be
produced that aren't actually an anagram of the input.  If you're using fancy
anagram expressions, double-check what you get back.</p>

<h2><a name="examples">Examples from MSPH 12(3)</a></h2>

<p>I'm using the Microsoft Puzzlehunt 12(3) as a source of examples mostly
just because I played in it recently, the solutions are online, and there
were a reasonable number of wordy puzzles.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that Nutrimatic does not solve these puzzles
automatically, it only helps with one specific part of the "crank turning".
It doesn't help you figure out what to do in the first place, and anyway most
of these puzzles require many other steps where a text grep engine like
Nutrimatic is unhelpful.</p>

<h4><a name="examples_camouflage" href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/Camouflage/">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This puzzle included many lines of text like "MOCHIT HATORY" with a blank in
the middle.  You were instructed to fill in a letter that would make a word
at least 5 letters using a possibly-empty suffix of the first part, a filled
in letter, and a possibly-empty prefix of the second part.  For that first
row, this pattern locates all such words:</p>

<pre><a href="/?q=%22(((((m?o)?c)?h)?i)?t)?_(h(a(t(o(ry?)?)?)?)?)?%26_{5,}%22">"(((((m?o)?c)?h)?i)t?)_(h(a(t(o(ry?)?)?)?)?)?&amp;_{5,}"</a></pre>

<p>Note that the puzzle directions further require "common non-plural,
non-capitalized English" words, and that each letter (A-Z) be used exactly once;
these constraints must be enforced by the human solver.</p>

<h4><a name="examples_dice" href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/Dice/">Dice</a></h4>

<p>After assembling a cube with spots on it, part of the final step in this
puzzle is to treat each side of the cube as a letter bank (such as AEHIMNPRSW)
and to determine the phrases that can be formed using that letter bank.  We
assume the puzzle designer didn't include any extraneous letters, so this is
like an anagram with repeated letters collapsed into one.  This pattern finds
what can be formed from one of these letter banks:</p>

<pre><a href="/?q=[aehimnprsw]*%26_*a_*%26_*e_*%26_*h_*%26_*i_*%26_*m_*%26_*n_*%26_*p_*%26_*r_*%26_*s_*%26_*w_*">[aehimnprsw]*&amp;_*a_*&amp;_*e_*&amp;_*h_*&amp;_*i_*&amp;_*m_*&amp;_*n_*&amp;_*p_*&amp;_*r_*&amp;_*s_*&amp;_*w_*</a></pre>

<p>This rather cumbersome expression requires a phrase made from letters in the
bank and also (this is the cumbersome part) requires each letter to be used
at least once somewhere in the phrase.  The answer to this one, "new
hampshire", comes out on top.  (Turns out each of the six sides decodes to a
state.)</p>

<h4><a name="examples_walkoffame" href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame/">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a></h4>

<p>One of the steps in the second phase of this puzzle involved identifying
a series of rebus-like drawings, and then concatenating the names of the
depicted objects with one letter removed from each.  For example, one of the
stars contained drawings of CHARM, ELTON, CHEST, and ONE.  This pattern finds
what can be made from this with one letter dropped from each:</p>

<pre><a href="/?q=%28c%3Fh%3Fa%3Fr%3Fm%3F%26_%7B4%7D%29%28e%3Fl%3Ft%3Fo%3Fn%3F%26_%7B4%7D%29%28c%3Fh%3Fe%3Fs%3Ft%3F%26_%7B4%7D%29%28o%3Fn%3Fe%3F%26_%7B2%7D%29">(c?h?a?r?m?&amp;_{4})(e?l?t?o?n?&amp;_{4})(c?h?e?s?t?&amp;_{4})(o?n?e?&amp;_{2})</a></pre>

<p>Within each word, every letter is optional, but a constraint is also added
to the subpattern requiring that N-1 of the letters be used.  The answer
"charlton heston" comes out on top.</p>

<h4><a name="examples_murderbydepth" href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/MurderByDepth/">Murder By Depth</a></h4>

<p>After finding this puzzle in a pool of water, you need to take a number of
nonsense strings like "SEPAP" and "HEGM" and "add water" by inserting the
letters W, A, T, E, R -- in that order, but not necessarily consecutively --
into the given letters.  This pattern finds the answer for HEGM:</p>

<pre><a href="/?q=%3Cwaterhegm%3E%26_*w_*a_*t_*e_*r_*">&lt;waterhegm&gt;&amp;_*w_*a_*t_*e_*r_*</a></pre>

<p>The word is required to be an anagram of &lt;waterhegm&gt; with the added
constraint that the letters in "water" appear in that order.  The answer "wheat
germ" shows up on top.</p>

<h4><a name="examples_mortaljeopardy" href="http://bloodandbones.com/ph12sim/puzzles/Mortal%20Jeopardy/">Mortal Jeopardy</a></h4>

<p>This meta for the third round was quite involved, but in the end produced
a series of (mostly) three-letter chunks.  The series was in the right order,
but the chunks were scrambled internally:</p>

<pre><a href="/?q=%3Chet%3E%3Cral%3E%3Cseg%3E%3Ctan%3E%3Crut%3E%3Cbla%3E%3Coody%3E%3Cafl%3E%3Cndi%3E%3Ccin%3E%3Cawe%3E%3Cter%3E">&lt;het&gt;&lt;ral&gt;&lt;seg&gt;&lt;tan&gt;&lt;rut&gt;&lt;bla&gt;&lt;oody&gt;&lt;afl&gt;&lt;ndi&gt;&lt;cin&gt;&lt;awe&gt;&lt;ter&gt;</a></pre>

<p>The answer, "the largest natural body of land in ice water", shows up first.
(Interpreting it requires some cleverness by the human solver!)</p>

<h2><a name="how">How It Works (and Why It's So Slow Sometimes)</a></h2>

<p>Internally, Nutrimatic uses a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> which includes every word
or phrase that occurs in Wikipedia at least five times -- 23,744,883 all told,
packed into a 258MB index file.  Every node in the trie includes a frequency
count.  (For example, the prefix "th" occurs 75,979,024 times; "qu" occurs
1,446,508 times.)</p>

<p>When searching for a pattern, Nutrimatic uses a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search">best-first search</a>
through the trie using a priority queue of nodes sorted by frequency.
The queue initially contains only the root node.  As long as the queue is not
empty, the algorithm takes the most frequent node from the queue and examines
it for compatibility with the search pattern.  If the path to that node
matches the pattern, it's printed as output.  If the path to that node is a
possible prefix for the pattern (not necessarily matching the pattern itself),
then the node's children are all added to the queue.  Then it returns to the
next best node in the queue and continues the process.</p>

<p>Whenever a space is encountered in the search, in addition to continuing to
the children of that node, the search algorithm also continues at the root of
the trie, allowing two words or phrases to be spliced together if they match
the pattern.  A heavy frequency penalty is added for this "reset", so that
phrases which occur naturally are considered before such "frankenphrases".</p>

<p>Because this process can involve evaluating very many nodes, and potentially
having a very large priority queue of nodes to process, the search expression is
converted to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_state_machine">deterministic
finite state machine</a> for rapid evaluation while searching.  The
<a href="http://www.openfst.org/">openfst</a> library is used to create,
combine and optimize the finite state machine as the query is parsed.</p>

<p>The creation of the finite state machine can be slow with complex patterns.
Ordinary regular expressions all compile extremely quickly, but patterns which
include many "&amp;" operators or long anagrams (which use the "&amp;" operator
internally for every part of the anagram) can result in large state machines:
Processing an anagram of length N requires O(2^N) states, and if the parts of
the anagram are themselves state machines the complexity is multiplied.  If
more than 30 CPU-seconds are consumed during this phase, the search is
killed.  Where possible, using more constrained, simpler patterns can help.</p>

<p>More commonly, the search process itself can take a long time as a large
number of nodes are visited.  After 1,000,000 nodes are visited, the search is
terminated (with the "Computation limit exceeded" message) whether or not any
results have been shown.</p>

<p>Because the search proceeds forward from the start of the answer string,
patterns which are constrained at the beginning work much better than patterns
which are constrained at the end.  For example,
<tt><a href="/?q=the_*">the_*</a></tt>
gives results very quickly;
<tt><a href="/?q=_*est">_*est</a></tt> takes a long time to return.  The first
pattern can walk the subtrie starting with "the"; the second pattern
effectively walks every word and phrase in the index in frequency order,
checking for each one whether it ends in "est".</p>

<p>Adding more constraints always helps the search -- for example, quoting
the search string is good if you don't expect the answer to contain multiple
words (or you know where word breaks go).</p>

<p>Finally, this particular instance is running on a multi-user computer, and
the 250MB+ index file has a way of getting paged out when people want to, you
know, read their mail or something.  So that can add a few seconds when first
using the service.</p>
